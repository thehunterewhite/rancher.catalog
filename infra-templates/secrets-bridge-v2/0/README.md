# Rancher Secrets Bridge v2 - Experimental Version

## Purpose

This volume driver delivers access tokens per-container to authenticate with Hashicorp Vault.

## Terms

**Instance token:** Vault token to be used by the container.

**Intermediate token:** A wrapped response token from Vault that will be used to access the instance token. These tokens are short lived.

**Issuing token:** Vault token that will be assigned a role, which can create all intermediate and instance tokens. If this token expires, all tokens issued will **also** expire.

## Setup

### Vault

1. Create a new role in Vault that encompasses all of the policies that will be used in an environment. Applications policy scope can be limited to a subset when requesting an access token.

```
vault write auth/token/roles/<your role name> allowed_policies=app1,default,etc
```

2. Create a policy that can be used for the issuing token.

```
path "auth/token/create/<role_name>" {
  capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
}

# Have access to revoke accessors
path "auth/token/revoke-accessor" {
  capabilities = ["update", "create"]
}

# Limit scope of grantor-default by denying access to all secrets
path "secret/*" {
  capabilities = ["deny"]
}
```

`vault policy-write <role>-issuing issuing-token.hcl`

3. Create an issuing token.

This token should:
* Be renewable
* Have a TTL of 3-12 hours. Note: This must be greater than 5 minutes.
* Be an orphan so that it isn't accidentally expired.

```
vault token-create -role=<role> -policy=<role>-issuing -ttl=3h -orphan
```

When creating the issuing token, you can add the following metadata to configure how intermediate and instance tokens will be configured.

* TTL for Instance Token (`-metadata=ttl=5m`): This sets the TTL for the instance token. Default: `5m`

* TTL for Intermediate Token (`-metadata=intermediateTTL=5m`): This sets the TTL for the intermediate token. Once this expires, the instance token will no longer be accessible. Default: `5m`

* Renewable (`-metadata=renewable=false`): This sets whether or not the instance tokens can be renewed. Default: `true`

### Launching this Template

Information required:

 - Issuing token stored as Rancher Secret
 - Vault Server URL
 - Vault issuing role

### Custom CA/Self signed certs

In order to for the Vault Token Driver to communicate with a Vault server behind a self-signed certificate, the CA pem file will need to be added to `/var/lib/rancher/etc/ssl/ca.crt` on each Rancher host in the environment.

## Using

Note: Services can only be launched using compose files when using the secrets bridge volume driver.

### Getting Tokens

In the example below, the containers in the service `testing` will get tokens with the `default` and `app1` policies applied.

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  testing:
    image: alpine
    volumes:
      - vault-token-0:/testing
    tty: true
    stdin_open: true
    command: sh
volumes:
  vault-token-0:
    driver: secrets-bridge-v2
    driver_opts:
      policies: "default,app1"
    # The volume must be per_container for this driver type.  
    per_container: true
```

The container will get an intermediate token written in the file `/testing/token`. The `/testing` folder is a tmpfs volume mount. The container must use this token, to retrieve the instance token.

The token can be retrieved with a call as follows:

```
curl -X POST -H 'X-Vault-Token: <contents of token file>' https://<vault_addr>:<vault_port>/v1/sys/wrapping/unwrap
```

Using the retrieved token, you can now access Vault within the scope of the assigned policies.

To change the policies of the token, a new volume will need to be created and assigned. By changing the volume from `vault-token-0` to `vault-token-1`, a new volume will be created after upgrading the service using CLI.

## Security Considerations

### Security scope

This stack continues with the Rancher environment as the security boundary. There are some mechanisms in place to mitigate attacks and make it more difficult for an attacker to gain access to Vault.

Requesting tokens from a host, require a signed request using the hosts private key file. This signature if verified using the public key stored in Rancher Server. The key pair is generated during the hosts registration process. Signatures are only valid for 5 minutes. The response on a token create request is RSA Encrypted using the hosts public key and is only accessible using the private key of the host that signed the request. This should mitigate replay attacks should a third party obtain a request form the network on a remote host.

The issuing token is delivered via Rancher Secret. It is the most secure method available in Rancher. This does mean at least one host in an environment will contain the Vault issuing token. This token should only be allowed to issue tokens scoped to the Rancher environment it is being used in.
