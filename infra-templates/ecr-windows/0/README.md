# Rancher ECR Credentials Updater for Windows Environment

A Docker service that will update the Docker registry
credentials in Rancher for an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

Originally contributed by John Engelman from [Object Partners](http://www.objectpartners.com).

## Changelog - v3.0.0

### ecr-updater [rancher/rancher-ecr-credentials-windows:v3.0.0]
* Refer to ecr-updater for Linux environment[rancher/rancher-ecr-credentials:v2.0.1].
* Add Windows support for ecr-updater and build the image base on microsoft/nanoserver.

## Why is this needed?

ECR is controlled with AWS IAM and registries in Rancher are verified using credentials (i.e. username and password). These credentials expire every 12 hours and need to be constantly updated.

> **Note:** This application runs on a 6 hour loop. There is a possibility where there could be a slight gap where the credentials expire before this program updates them.

## How to use

In order to authenticate with AWS ECR, this Docker service uses the default
chain of [credential providers](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#config-settings-and-precedence).

The only requirement for running this application is to specify the AWS region using the `AWS_REGION` environment variable.

AWS credentials are loaded using the default [AWS credential chain](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/latest/v1/developerguide/configuring-sdk.title.html).
Credentials are loaded in the following order:

1. Environment variables (Specify `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` *(optional)*)
1. Shared credentials file (mount a volume to `/root/.aws` that contains `credentials` and `config` files and specify `AWS_PROFILE`)
1. IAM Instance Profile (if running on EC2)

> **Note:** Cross account roles are not currently supported.

You can update registries in other environments by providing the environment API endpoint of the environment containing the AWS registry to be updated. You will also need to provide the an Environment API key (access key and secret key) for the environment.

## Notes

The AWS credentials must correspond to an IAM user that has permissions to call the ECR `GetToken` API. The application will parse the resulting response to retrieve the ECR registry URL, username, and password. The returned registry URL, is used to discover the corresponding registry in Rancher.
